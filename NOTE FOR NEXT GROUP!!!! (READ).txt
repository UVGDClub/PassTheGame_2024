NOTE:

- Card merging needs an icon that hasn't been made yet (is this feature even needed?)
- Card types still need to be implemented correctly (specifically passive and consumables)
- The text on the bottom right of the screen has a shadow applied that is permanenetly grey. If that can be changed so that the color fits the background color it would look better.
- The life system is not finished. All of the right icons have been added for use though. 
- The blue hollow shape underneath the hearts is a stamina bar. This bar should display how much stamina the player has. This feature has not been implemented yet. 
- All of the UI elements can be found and edited as necesary on the affinity designer file provided in the game's files. Simply click on the Affinity Files folder. 
- If someone is adventerous enough to mess with the tilemap, there are new sprites in the assets folder, I just couldn't figure out how to change the current tilemap without it breaking so I just pasted the new tiles over the old ones as a temp fix


Good luck! We certainly needed it :)
