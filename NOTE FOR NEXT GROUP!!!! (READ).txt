NOTE:

- Card merging needs an icon that hasn't been made yet (is this feature even needed?)
- Card types still need to be implemented correctly (specifically passive and consumables)
- The text on the bottom right of the screen has a shadow applied that is permanenetly grey. If that can be changed so that the color fits the background color it would look better.
- The life system is not finished. But it does have UI implementation.
- All of the UI elements can be found and edited as necesary on the affinity designer file provided in the game's files. Simply click on the Affinity Files folder.
- If someone is adventerous enough to mess with the tilemap, there are new sprites in the assets folder, I just couldn't figure out how to change the current tilemap without it breaking so I just pasted the new tiles over the old ones as a temp fix

Good luck! We certainly needed it :)
- this file was from a previous group, not the group who came before you though
- well i guess to be absolutely correct i edited it a bit so that it wasn't completely out of date
